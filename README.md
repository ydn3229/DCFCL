# FedCIL

 Implementation of *Decentralized Dynamic Cooperation of Personalized Models for Federated Continual Learning, NeurIPS' 25*



## Usage

1. Install some of required packages. You can also install them manually.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt # install requirements
```

2. Download the processed dataset here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7li0NbFWbdaMsqpGUGevEYbT8TAsAx3/view?usp=share_link).
   Unzip this file and place it in the root directory.

3. To run our models:

```
python main.py
```


 add an auxiliary classification head to the top of the discriminator as introduced in [AC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585.pdf).
